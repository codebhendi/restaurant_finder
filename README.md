# Instructions

2. Go to node folder.
3. run ```npm run install```.
4. This will install all dependencies.

## Web
1. To run web service you need to have node and npm installed.
2. To run development server of react you need to install react-scripts. That is done using ```npm install -g react-scripts```.
3. run ```npm run install```.
4. This will install all dependencies.

All our dependencies and api tokens are in the code itself.

1. Go on the interface and click on any location near which you want to obtain the restaurants.
2. Then click on ```get restaurants``` button to get a list of restaurants.
3. After that a list of restaurant will be shown.

## Missing features
1. I am not showing what location you have selected. I wanted to show a marker whenever you click
on some particular location. Then it would have been easier for user to see what the are actually looking for.
2. I am also not showing location markers for restaurants which also would have been helpful to the users.
Adding a marker is possible in mapbox's api. But it was taking too much time hence decided to not do that right now.
